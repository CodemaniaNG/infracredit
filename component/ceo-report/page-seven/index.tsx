      <p>Key updates on the various on-going workstreams within the Risk Management group include:</p>
      <p>
        § The design of InfraCredit’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment (ICAAP) framework was concluded during the period by PwC and InfraCredit’s risk team. The exercise
        entailed detailed review of our current risk management framework, gap assessment of our existing capital management process, design and documentation of the recommended
        ICAAP methodology/framework. We expect to obtain board approval for the methodologies within the first month of Q2, 2022 for complete implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        § The project to deliver a Risk Management automated dashboard (PowerBI) for executive management use was also deployed during the quarter. This allows access to our
        guarantee portfolio reports, amongst other features. The agreed methodologies have been deployed to the live environment and currently been updated with current portfolio
        details before final sign off.
      </p>
      <p>
        § Rating, Pricing and Impairment Model: The modified version that incorporated additional functionalities raised by the Risk Team was delivered by KPMG during the quarter.
        However, the User Acceptance Session held resulted in the need for further enhancements that include autogeneration of amortization schedule for our guaranteed bonds and
        other instruments, amongst others.
