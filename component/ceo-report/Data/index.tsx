        "Following a strong rebound in 2021, when the global economy was estimated to have grown by 5.5%, the World Bank recently raised concern on likely slowdown in the recovery momentum, citing COVID-19 flare up, diminished fiscal support and lingering supply chain bottlenecks. In its Global Economic Prospects 2022, the World Bank projects the world output would rise by only 4.1% in 2022 and may slow further to 3.2% in 2023, as inflationary pressures and the need to wind stimulus programmes dampen near term outlook.",
        "Nigeria’s economy grew 3.98% in the fourth quarter of 2021, the fifth consecutive positive quarterly growth since recovery from the recession, putting the overall GDP growth for the year at 3.4%. This stellar recovery represents the largest economic growth in 7 years driven largely by low base effects, border reopening, accommodative monetary policy, and technology. Though agriculture, telecommunication (ICT) and trade are proving resilient, with 2.3%, 6.6% and 8.6% growth respectively, the World Bank projects the country would only grow 2.5% in 2022, a relatively bearish outlook when compared to the 4.2% target of the Federal Government of Nigeria.",
        "The CBN monetary policy committee sustains the benchmark interest rate at 11.5%, reflecting the appetite of the policy authority to support growth, even as global interest rate rises. Interestingly, the trend of headline inflation remained relatively benign, with headline inflation printing at 15.6% in January 2022, following consistent ease from the 18.17% peak in March 2021. Whilst yields on sovereign instruments rose an average of 450bps in 2021, the dovish stance of the CBN and broader monetary policy halted the rise, as the sovereign yield curve eased an average of 50bps year-to-date, with the most impact being on long tenored sovereign notes. The  Naira remains volatile, hovering between N405 and N440/USD at the investors and exporters window, whilst trading at N575/USD at the parallel market. The expiration of tax holiday on corporate bonds and other debt instruments throws up a new pricing regime, as investors begin to price the tax-equivalent yield of non-sovereign instruments. Analysts report that the recent Russian-Ukraine conflict could have an adverse impact on post-pandemic economic recovery with rise in imported food inflation rate, rise in oil and natural gas prices (including oil subsidy bill) as well as the potential worsening of global supply chain constraints.",

        "As the year progresses, we expect the economy to remain resilient, albeit, we think there may not be any major economic policy reform in 2022, given expected distractions from political activities. With the sunset of the tax holiday on corporate bonds (including InfraCredit guaranteed debt securities), the credit spread between comparable FGN benchmark bond and corporate notes is expected to widen, with investors seeking a higher premium on investment grade corporate bonds to compensate for the tax burden.  Whilst pension funds, who are major investors in InfraCredit-guaranteed debt notes, are not subjected to the new tax regime, they may want to take advantage of the policy  to improve on their portfolio yield. We opened the year, with the guarantee of Pan-African Tower’s N10 billion Series I Bonds, under the N50 Billion Programme, the transaction closed at 55bps spread over the FGN benchmark, reinforcing the credibility of the guarantee and increasing appetite of pension funds to support financing of  viable infrastructure assets. In line with our risk sharing strategy, we also implemented a 50:50 risk sharing with Africa Trade Insurance on PAT. We are actively working towards our FY 2022 guarantee target of N103 Billion by accelerating our mandated/contracted deal pipeline of 34 transactions to N301 Billion and increasing aggregate (19) credit committee approved transactions to N139.5 Billion as at 28 February 2022. Execution capacity and conversion rate is a critical success factor, barring any unexpected impact on the markets and client delays We also aim to unlock new deal flow by successfully implementing strategic initiatives alongside our Development Partners such as the Affordable Housing Funding Programme, Private Corporate Bonds Programme, Clean Energy Funding Programme, Project Development Support, Technical Assistance Funding, amongst others.",
